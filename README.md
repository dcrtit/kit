## Contribution

This repository is handled by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), so it'll be good to start of with learning the basics.

First of, you'll need to install certain dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You are good to go. Now, try running `npm run dev`, this will start `vite`-based UI components playground.
