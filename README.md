Here will be the collection of "reusables" and components which were developed during the whole period of our cooperative work together.

## Development

This repository is handled by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), so it'll be good to start of with learning the basics.

First of, you'll need to install certain dependencies:

```shell
# Primary deps
npm install

# Packages' deps
lerna bootstrap
```

And you are good to go.
